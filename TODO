GET DYNAMIC LINKING TO WORK AT RUNTIME (WORKS AT COMPILE TIME)

GLinput polling implementation (CURRENTLY WORKING ON)

    SUPER IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS COULD BE A BIG OPTIMIZATION DOWN THE ROAD 
        -----> LOOK INTO SETTING WINDOW AND JOYSTICK USER POINTERS TO ACCESS CONTEXTUAL DATA FROM WITHIN CALLBACKS (THESE USER POINTERS COULD BE OPERATION STATES (acting as structs))

    Use (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_KEY) == GLFW_PRESS | REPEAT) to manage inputs
    look into using glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_MOD_SHIFT, GLFW_TRUE) for shift + key press/repeat

OpenGL Work:

    Completed:
        Shader compilation seems to work.
        Shader linking works.
        Can draw triangles.

    TODO:
        Draw square.
        Look into abstracting the process of using VAOs and VBOs to draw to screen using an array of vertex points.
        Change color on keypress.
        Translate object in 2D space using keyboard and controller.
    

Dont forget to update gl_terminate() whenever there are things that need to be terminated at program termination

Look into CIMGUI https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui and the example https://github.com/peko/cimgui-c-example/blob/master/src/main.c
