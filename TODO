GET DYNAMIC LINKING TO WORK AT RUNTIME (WORKS AT COMPILE TIME)

GLinput polling implementation (CURRENTLY WORKING ON)

    SUPER IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS COULD BE A BIG OPTIMIZATION DOWN THE ROAD 
        -----> LOOK INTO SETTING WINDOW AND JOYSTICK USER POINTERS TO ACCESS CONTEXTUAL DATA FROM WITHIN CALLBACKS (THESE USER POINTERS COULD BE OPERATION STATES (acting as structs))

    Use (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_KEY) == GLFW_PRESS | REPEAT) to manage inputs
    look into using glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_MOD_SHIFT, GLFW_TRUE) for shift + key press/repeat

OpenGL Work:
    Shader compilation seems to work.
    Shader linking works.

Dont forget to update gl_terminate() whenever there are things that need to be terminated at program termination

Look into CIMGUI https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui and the example https://github.com/peko/cimgui-c-example/blob/master/src/main.c
